The following steps should get you up and running with Riak on Debian or Ubuntu 9.10.  You can install from source or from our custom .deb package.

h2. From our custom .deb package

To install from our pre-built package, run these commands for the appropriate platform:

h3. 64-bit


```bash
$ wget http://downloads.basho.com/riak/riak-1.0.2/riak_1.0.2-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i riak_1.0.2-1_amd64.deb
```


h3. 32-bit


```bash
$ wget http://downloads.basho.com/riak/riak-1.0.2/riak_1.0.2-1_i386.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i riak_1.0.2-1_i386.deb
```

The installation process will create a user named `riak`, but you will need to to create /home/riak and run `chown riak:riak /home/riak` before running `riak start`.

h2. From source

Riak requires [[Erlang|http://www.erlang.org/]] R14B03 or later. If you do not have Erlang already installed, see [[Installing Erlang]]. Don't worry, it's easy!

Let's install the dependencies that we can from apt:


```bash
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libc6-dev-i386
```

If you have not installed Erlang, please [[do so|Installing Erlang]].

Now we can download and install Riak:

```bash
$ wget http://downloads.basho.com/riak/riak-1.0.2/riak-1.0.2.tar.gz
$ tar zxvf riak-1.0.2.tar.gz
$ cd riak-1.0.2
$ make rel
```

There should now be a fresh build of Riak in the rel/riak directory.
